# JIRA Discord AWS Lambda Webhook
A simple AWS lambda function that takes a JIRA webhook payload, creates a Discord compatible webhook payload and executes the appropriate Discord webhook. See my [blog post](https://andyczerwonka.com/discord-for-software-development-teams-34eb025d6440) for a little more information on why I created it and how it works.
